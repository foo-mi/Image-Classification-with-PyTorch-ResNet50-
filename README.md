**Description:** Deployed a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image classification on CPU-based infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes PyTorch's pre-trained ResNet50 (ImageNet weights)
- CPU-optimized inference pipeline
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- 1000-class ImageNet classification

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, torchvision, PIL

**Results:** Successfully classified test images with high accuracy using CPU inference.

**What I Learned:**
- Loading and deploying pre-trained models
- Image preprocessing pipelines
- Running efficient inference on CPU
- Understanding model architecture and inference optimization
